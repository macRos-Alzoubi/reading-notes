# Spring Authorization

## Spring Boot and OAuth2

This guide shows you how to build a sample app doing various things with "social login" using OAuth 2.0 and Spring Boot.

It starts with a simple, single-provider single-sign on, and works up to a client with a choice of authentication
providers: GitHub or Google.

The samples are all single-page apps using Spring Boot and Spring Security on the back end. They also all use plain
`jQuery` on the front end. But, the changes needed to convert to a different JavaScript framework or to use server-side
rendering would be minimal.

There are several samples building on each other, adding new features at each step:

- **simple**: a very basic static app with just a home page and unconditional login via Spring Boot’s OAuth 2.0
  configuration properties (if you visit the home page, you will be automatically redirected to GitHub).
- **click**: adds an explicit link that the user has to click to login.
- **logout**: adds a logout link as well for authenticated users.
- **two-providers**: adds a second login provider so the user can choose on the home page which one to use.
- **custom-error**: adds an error message for unauthenticated users, and a custom authentication based on GitHub’s API.

### Single Sign On With GitHub

- **Creating a New Project**

First, you need to create a Spring Boot application, which can be done in a number of ways. The easiest is to go
to https://start.spring.io and generate an empty project (choosing the "Web" dependency as a starting point).
Equivalently, do this on the command line:

`
$ mkdir ui && cd ui $ curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz -d style=web -d name=simple | tar -xzvf -
`

- **Add a Home Page**

In your new project, create index.html in the src/main/resources/static folder. You should add some stylesheets and
JavaScript links.

- **Securing the Application with GitHub and Spring Security**

To make the application secure, you can simply add Spring Security as a dependency. Since you’re wanting to do a "
social" login (delegate to GitHub), you should include the Spring Security OAuth 2.0 Client starter:

```
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

By adding that, it will secure your app with OAuth 2.0 by default.

Next, you need to configure your app to use GitHub as the authentication provider. To achieve this, do the following:

- Add a New GitHub app
- Configure application.yml
- Boot up the application

#### Add a New GitHub App

To use GitHub’s OAuth 2.0 authentication system for login, you must first Add a new GitHub app.

Select "New OAuth App" and then the "Register a new OAuth application" page is presented. Enter an app name and
description. Then, enter your app’s home page, which should be http://localhost:8080, in this case. Finally, indicate
the Authorization callback URL as http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/github and click Register Application.

The OAuth redirect URI is the path in the application that the end-user’s user-agent is redirected back to after they
have authenticated with GitHub and have granted access to the application on the Authorize application page.

#### Configure application.yml

Then, to make the link to GitHub, add the following to your application.yml:

application.yml

`
spring:
security:
oauth2:
client:
registration:
github:
clientId: github-client-id clientSecret: github-client-secret

# ...

`
Simply use the OAuth 2.0 credentials you just created with GitHub, replacing github-client-id with the client id and
github-client-secret with the client secret.

#### Boot Up the Application

With that change, you can run your app again and visit the home page at http://localhost:8080. Now, instead of the home
page, you should be redirected to login with GitHub. If you do that, and accept any authorizations you are asked to
make, you will be redirected back to the local app, and the home page will be visible.

If you stay logged in to GitHub, you won’t have to re-authenticate with this local app, even if you open it in a fresh
browser with no cookies and no cached data. (That’s what Single Sign-On means.)

It’s safe to grant access to this sample since only the app running locally can use the tokens and the scope it asks for
is limited. Be aware of what you are approving when you log into apps like this though: They might ask for permission to
do more than you are comfortable with (e.g. they might ask for permission to change your personal data, which is
unlikely to be in your interest).
