# Spring RESTful Routing & Static Files

## Spring RequestMapping

`@RequestMapping`.

Simply put, the annotation is used to map web requests to Spring Controller methods.

### @RequestMapping Basics

- **@RequestMapping — by Path**

```springdataql
@RequestMapping(value = "/ex/foos", method = RequestMethod.GET)
@ResponseBody
public String getFoosBySimplePath() {
    return "Get some Foos";
}
```

- To test
  `curl -i http://localhost:8080/spring-rest/ex/foos`

### @RequestMapping — the HTTP Method

The HTTP method parameter has no default. So, if we don't specify a value, it's going to map to any HTTP request.

Here's a simple example, similar to the previous one, but this time mapped to an HTTP POST request:

```springdataql
@RequestMapping(value = "/ex/foos", method = POST)
@ResponseBody
public String postFoos() {
    return "Post some Foos";
}
```

## RequestMapping and HTTP Headers

- **@RequestMapping With the headers Attribute**

The mapping can be narrowed even further by specifying a header for the request:

```springdataql
@RequestMapping(value = "/ex/foos", headers = "key=val", method = GET)
@ResponseBody
public String getFoosWithHeader() {
    return "Get some Foos with Header";
}
```

`curl -i -H "key:val" http://localhost:8080/spring-rest/ex/foos`

and even multiple headers via the headers attribute of @RequestMapping:

```springdataql
@RequestMapping(
  value = "/ex/foos", 
  headers = { "key1=val1", "key2=val2" }, method = GET)
@ResponseBody
public String getFoosWithHeaders() {
    return "Get some Foos with Header";
}
```

`curl -i -H "key1:val1" -H "key2:val2" http://localhost:8080/spring-rest/ex/foos`

- **@RequestMapping Consumes and Produces**

Mapping media types produced by a controller method is worth special attention.

We can map a request based on its Accept header via the @RequestMapping headers attribute introduced above:

```springdataql
@RequestMapping(
  value = "/ex/foos", 
  method = GET, 
  headers = "Accept=application/json")
@ResponseBody
public String getFoosAsJsonFromBrowser() {
    return "Get some Foos with Header Old";
}
```

`curl -H "Accept:application/json,text/html"
http://localhost:8080/spring-rest/ex/foos`

### RequestMapping With Path Variables

#### Single @PathVariable

```springdataql
@RequestMapping(value = "/ex/foos/{id}", method = GET)
@ResponseBody
public String getFoosBySimplePathWithPathVariable(
  @PathVariable("id") long id) {
    return "Get a specific Foo with id=" + id;
}
```

`curl http://localhost:8080/spring-rest/ex/foos/1`

If the name of the method parameter matches the name of the path variable exactly, then this can be simplified by using
@PathVariable with no value:

```springdataql
@RequestMapping(value = "/ex/foos/{id}", method = GET)
@ResponseBody
public String getFoosBySimplePathWithPathVariable(
  @PathVariable String id) {
    return "Get a specific Foo with id=" + id;
}
```

#### Multiple @PathVariable

A more complex URI may need to map multiple parts of the URI to multiple values:

```springdataql
@RequestMapping(value = "/ex/foos/{fooid}/bar/{barid}", method = GET)
@ResponseBody
public String getFoosBySimplePathWithPathVariables
  (@PathVariable long fooid, @PathVariable long barid) {
    return "Get a specific Bar with id=" + barid + 
      " from a Foo with id=" + fooid;
}
```

#### @PathVariable With Regex

Regular expressions can also be used when mapping the @PathVariable.

For example, we will restrict the mapping to only accept numerical values for the id:

```springdataql
@RequestMapping(value = "/ex/bars/{numericId:[\\d]+}", method = GET)
@ResponseBody
public String getBarsBySimplePathWithPathVariable(
  @PathVariable long numericId) {
    return "Get a specific Bar with id=" + numericId;
}
```

## Accessing Data with JPA

### Define a Simple Entity

In this example, you store Customer objects, each annotated as a JPA entity. The following listing shows the Customer
class (in src/main/java/com/example/accessingdatajpa/Customer.java):

```java
package com.example.accessingdatajpa;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
public class Customer {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;

    protected Customer() {
    }

    public Customer(String firstName, String lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return String.format(
                "Customer[id=%d, firstName='%s', lastName='%s']",
                id, firstName, lastName);
    }

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getFirstName() {
        return firstName;
    }

    public String getLastName() {
        return lastName;
    }
}
```

Here you have a Customer class with three attributes: id, firstName, and lastName. You also have two constructors. The
default constructor exists only for the sake of JPA. You do not use it directly, so it is designated as protected. The
other constructor is the one you use to create instances of Customer to be saved to the database.

The Customer class is annotated with `@Entity`, indicating that it is a `JPA` entity. (Because no @Table annotation
exists, it is assumed that this entity is mapped to a table named Customer.)

The Customer object’s id property is annotated with `@Id` so that JPA recognizes it as the object’s ID. The id property
is also annotated with `@GeneratedValue` to indicate that the ID should be generated automatically.

The other two properties, firstName and lastName, are left unannotated. It is assumed that they are mapped to columns
that share the same names as the properties themselves.

The convenient `toString()` method print outs the customer’s properties.

### Create Simple Queries

Spring Data JPA focuses on using JPA to store data in a relational database. Its most compelling feature is the ability
to create repository implementations automatically, at runtime, from a repository interface.

To see how this works, create a repository interface that works with Customer entities as the following listing (in
src/main/java/com/example/accessingdatajpa/CustomerRepository.java) shows:

```java
package com.example.accessingdatajpa;

import java.util.List;

import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;

public interface CustomerRepository extends CrudRepository<Customer, Long> {

    List<Customer> findByLastName(String lastName);

    Customer findById(long id);
}
```

CustomerRepository extends the CrudRepository interface. The type of entity and ID that it works with, Customer and
Long, are specified in the generic parameters on CrudRepository. By extending CrudRepository, CustomerRepository
inherits several methods for working with Customer persistence, including methods for saving, deleting, and finding
Customer entities.

Spring Data JPA also lets you define other query methods by declaring their method signature. For example,
CustomerRepository includes the findByLastName() method.

In a typical Java application, you might expect to write a class that implements CustomerRepository. However, that is
what makes Spring Data JPA so powerful: You need not write an implementation of the repository interface. Spring Data
JPA creates an implementation when you run the application.

Now you can wire up this example and see what it looks like!
