## Intro to Serverless

### Focus on your application, not the infrastructure

Sounds relieving though, knowing a lot of your daylight hours go into implementing, maintaining, debugging, and monitoring the infrastructure. With all of that infrastructure heavy lifting out of the way, we really can focus on the business goals our applications serve. A lot of productive efforts could be channeled in the right direction, where they were meant to be ideally. Maybe it sounds too good to be true, but this is the way things should have been. At least for those of you who cant afford to spend a lot of time caught up in the web of intricacies in modern complex infrastructure.

### So, What is Serverless?

Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider. Pricing is based on the number of executions rather than pre-purchased compute capacity.

## AWS Amplify Kool-Aid

### How it works

AWS Amplify is a set of purpose-built tools and services that makes it quick and easy for front-end web and mobile developers build full-stack applications on AWS, with the flexibility to leverage the breadth of AWS services to further customize applications. Amplify supports popular languages, frameworks, and platforms, including `JavaScript`, `React`, `Angular`, `Vue`, and `Next.js` for web apps and `Android`, `iOS`, `React Native`, `Ionic`, and `Flutter` for mobile apps.

## GraphQL @connection

## Directives

The Amplify CLI provides GraphQL directives to enhance your schema with additional capabilities such as custom indexes, authorization rules, function triggers, and more.

### Amplify-provided directives

- `@model`: Defines top level object types in your API that are backed by Amazon DynamoDB
- `@key`: Configures custom index structures for @model types
- `@auth`: Defines authorization rules for your @model types and fields
- `@connection`: Defines 1:1, 1:M, and N:M relationships between @model types
- `@function`: Configures a Lambda function resolvers for a field
- `@http`: Configures an HTTP resolver for a field
- `@predictions`: Queries an orchestration of AI/ML services such as Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Translate, and/or Amazon Polly
- `@searchable`: Makes your data searchable by streaming it to Amazon OpenSearch
- `@versioned`: Defines the versioning and conflict resolution strategy for an @model type

### AWS AppSync-provided directives

The following directives are supported by the AppSync service and can be used within the Amplify GraphQL schemas. These will not be processed by Amplify CLI but passed through to the service as is and will be present in the output schema. For example, Amplify's `@auth` directive will add these directives under the hood to the output schema.

- `@aws_api_key`
- `@aws_iam`
- `@aws_oidc`
- `@aws_cognito_user_pools`
- `@aws_auth`
- `@aws_subscribe`

### 3rd party directives

- `@algolia`: Add serverless search to your Amplify API with Algolia
- `@ttl`: Enable DynamoDB's time-to-live feature to auto-delete old entries in your AWS Amplify API
- `@firehose`: Add a simple interceptor to all of your Amplify API mutations and queries
- `@retain`: Enable the "Retain" deletion policy for your Amplify-generated DynamoDB tables.
