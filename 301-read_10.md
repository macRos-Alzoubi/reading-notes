### What causes a Stack Overflow?

A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

## JavaScript error messages

### What is a ‘refrence error’?

This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.

### What is a ‘syntax error’?

I know it’s in the name of the errors, but like it says itself, this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.

### What is a ‘range error’?

Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.

### What is a ‘tyep error’?

Like the name indicates, this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

### What is a breakpoint?

using breakpoint will be able to see what has happened before that point and you can try and evaluate the next lines to check if everything is outputting what you are expecting.

### What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

debugger will put a Breackpoit in your code in the line you want to break.
