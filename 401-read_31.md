## Espresso Testing

Use Espresso to write concise, beautiful, and reliable Android UI tests.

The core API is small, predictable, and easy to learn and yet remains open for customization. Espresso tests state expectations, interactions, and assertions clearly without the distraction of boilerplate content, custom infrastructure, or messy implementation details getting in the way.

Espresso tests run optimally fast! It lets you leave your waits, syncs, sleeps, and polls behind while it manipulates and asserts on the application UI when it is at rest.

### Synchronization capabilities

Each time your test invokes `onView()`, Espresso waits to perform the corresponding UI action or assertion until the following synchronization conditions are met:

- The message queue is empty.
- There are no instances of AsyncTask currently executing a task.
- All developer-defined idling resources are idle.

By performing these checks, Espresso substantially increases the likelihood that only one UI action or assertion can occur at any given time. This capability gives you more reliable and dependable test results.

### Packages

- `espresso-core` - Contains core and basic View matchers, actions, and assertions. See Basics and Recipes.
- `espresso-web` - Contains resources for WebView support.
- `espresso-idling`-resource - Espresso's mechanism for synchronization with background jobs.
- `espresso-contrib` - External contributions that contain DatePicker, RecyclerView and Drawer actions, accessibility checks, and - CountingIdlingResource.
- `espresso-intents` - Extension to validate and stub intents for hermetic testing.
- `espresso-remote` - Location of Espresso's multi-process functionality.

## Create UI tests with Espresso Test Recorder

The Espresso Test Recorder tool lets you create UI tests for your app without writing any test code. By recording a test scenario, you can record your interactions with a device and add assertions to verify UI elements in particular snapshots of your app.

### Turn off animations on your test device

Before using Espresso Test Recorder, make sure you turn off animations on your test device to prevent unexpected results

### Record an Espresso test

Espresso tests consist of two primary components: UI interactions and assertions on View elements. UI interactions include tap and type actions that a person may use to interact with your app. Assertions verify the existence or contents of visual elements on the screen.
