## Review: High-level HTTP

### The HTTP Request Lifecycle

#### Step 1: Local Processing

Much can happen during this step depending on the application making the request.

1. Your browser extracts the "scheme"/protocol (we have established that this will be HTTP), host (www.example.com), and
   optional port number, resource path, and query strings that are specified in the form

   `<protocol>://<host><:optional port>/<path/to/resource><?query>`
   i.g: `|http|://|www.example.com||:5000||/mainpage||?query=param&query2=param2|`


2. Now that the browser has the intended hostname for the request, it needs to resolve an IP address1. The browser will
   then look through its own cache of recently requested URLs, the operating system’s cache of recent queries, your
   router’s cache, and your DNS cache.

#### Step 2: Resolve an IP

Like the processing done locally, resolving an IP from a "DNS server"2 is a sequence that includes many steps, and
includes failovers if the first request fails to return an address.

1. If the cache lookup fails (we will assume it does)
   , your browser fires off a DNS request using UDP3. The DNS request contains the preconfigured IP for your DNS server
   and your return IP in its header. The hostname for which you are trying to resolve an IP is in the request’s "
   Question"
   section. UDP is a lightweight protocol, but the tradeoff is that it offers no guarantees in terms of delivery, and
   there is no acknowledgement other than a response being sent and received.

2. Your request will now have to travel many network devices to reach its target DNS server. Whenever the packet hits a
   piece of networking equipment, the device uses a routing table to determine which other device it is connected to
   that is most likely situated along the shortest path to the destination.

3. Once your request arrives at your configured DNS server, the server looks for the address associated with the
   requested hostname. If it finds one, it sends a response. If, on the other hand, the DNS server you have targeted
   cannot locate the given hostname, it passes the request along to another DNS server it is configured to defer to.
   This happens recursively until the address is found, or an "authoritative" nameserver is hit. If an address for the
   given domain cannot be resolved, the server responds with a failure and your browser returns an error.

4. We will assume the request is successful though, given that all of this is still a precursor. If the response makes
   it back (remember, with UDP there’s no guarantee!), the requesting client now has a target IP. It will also have
   received a piece of information as part of the answer that will let it know how long the returned answer can be
   cached for. This means subsequent requests will get to take a shortcut from Step 1.2 to here.

#### Step 3: Establish a TCP Connection

Now that the client has an IP address, it can send an HTTP5 request, right? Almost, but first, since the request is sent
over TCP6, which is a transport layer protocol like UDP, the client must open a TCP connection.

1. One of the key differences between TCP and UDP is that TCP ensures delivery and ordered data transmission. Much of
   this is done very simply, using what’s known as a sequence number for every byte sent. This allows the receiver to
   re-order received packets back into their original order, and allows the sender to retransmit any packet that does
   not get acknowledged by the receiver.

2. TCP connections are opened using what’s known as a three-way handshake.The server must already be "listening" on a
   port, performing a passive open, after which the client can initiate an active open, and the handshake works as
   follows
    1. The client initiates the active open by sending a SYN7 "control"8 packet to the server. The client sets the
       sequence number for the first packet to a random value purposely, in service of security. We’ll refer to this
       number as x for now.
    2. The server responds with a SYN-ACK9 message, which contains an acknowledgement number for the original message
       that is always x+1, and a new sequence number for the response itself, which is another random number y.
    3. In the third step, the client sends an ACK10 message back to the server with a sequence number equal to x+1,
       which should match the SYN-ACK message’s acknowledgment number and ensure that our data is being delivered
       reliably. The ACK message’s acknowledgment number (since it is acknowledging the SYN-ACK) is set to one more than
       the received sequence number, or y+1.
3. We now have a completed three-way handshake and an established connection where both the client and server have
   received acknowledgment of the connection from the other party. The connection has also established a random,
   sequential sequence11 for each direction of communication (client->server, server->client), allowing for
   bidirectional, concurrent communication along the connection, which is also known as **full duplex communication**.

#### Step 4: Send an HTTP Request

Now that the client has an IP address and a TCP connection, it can finally send an HTTP request

1. The request is made up of a "request line", request header, and a body. The "request line" is simply a line that
   indicates the HTTP method, the resource being requested, and the protocol version. The header of the request is made
   up of pairs in the form name:value <CR><LF>. Two consecutive <CR><LF> pairs indicate the end of the header section.
   The only mandatory field in an HTTP request is HOST, which contains the domain and port that the request is being
   sent to (domain.com:8080), although in some cases the port can be omitted. Outside of the host field, common standard
   HTTP header fields include Origin, Accept, Accept-Encoding, and many more. The request can also include any
   non-standard header fields, and historically non-standard fields are indicated by prefixing X- to the field’s name.
   The body content of an HTTP request is completely optional, but often contains something like form data or JSON.
2. Once the HTTP request is sent, it follows a similar routing procedure as the one discussed earlier, with the
   difference being that using TCPs magic sequence number powers, the server can ensure it receives the whole request,
   in the correct order.
3. Once the server receives the request, processes it, and finds the resource being requested, it generates an HTTP
   response. An HTTP response has a similar structure to an HTTP request, containing a "status line", response header
   fields, and an optional body. The status line contains an HTTP status code indicating the success, failure, or
   error-state of the request along with a "reason message" that provides detail.
4. Once the response is generated, the server responds to the request. At the TCP layer, the client receives the first
   data packet, the first byte of which should contain the HTTP response header. More packets start coming in, and at
   the TCP layer they are re-ordered as needed. For every two packets that the client receives at the TCP layer, it
   sends an ACK message to the server. This goes on until the response is (hopefully) fully loaded.

#### Step 5: Tearing Down and Cleaning Up

1. Once the response has been fully delivered, the client sends a FIN packet at the TCP level, to which the server
   responds with an ACK, and then generally sends a FIN of its own, which the client responds to with its own ACK
   signal. The client then waits for a brief timeout, during which it cannot accept new connections, to prevent delayed
   packets from previous connections arriving during subsequent activities on the port. This four way handshake12
   signals the end of the TCP connection.
2. At this point, your browser begins processing what it has received. If it is an image, data, or other media file that
   is being consumed by some application inside the browser, a variety of things can happen. If the data received is
   HTML, the browser will start parsing the HTML, and rendering the page you requested. As it parses, the browser may
   come across links to images or other media that are external to the HTML it has received, and will spin up new
   requests for that content, restarting this whole process (although usually skipping steps 1 & 2 thanks to caching).

## Java HTTP Request example

- **HttpUrlConnection**

The HttpUrlConnection class allows us to perform basic HTTP requests without the use of any additional libraries. All
the classes that we need are part of the java.net package.

The disadvantages of using this method are that the code can be more cumbersome than other HTTP libraries and that it
does not provide more advanced functionalities such as dedicated methods for adding headers or authentication.

- **Creating a Request**

We can create an HttpUrlConnection instance using the openConnection() method of the URL class. Note that this method
only creates a connection object but doesn't establish the connection yet.

The HttpUrlConnection class is used for all types of requests by setting the requestMethod attribute to one of the
values: GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, TRACE.

- i.g:
    ```java
     URL url = new URL("http://example.com");
   
      HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
      con.setRequestMethod("GET");
   ```

- **Adding Request Parameters**

If we want to add parameters to a request, we have to set the doOutput property to true, then write a String of the form
param1=value¶m2=value to the OutputStream of the HttpUrlConnection instance:

```java
Map<String, String> parameters=new HashMap<>();
        parameters.put("param1","val");

        con.setDoOutput(true);
        DataOutputStream out=new DataOutputStream(con.getOutputStream());
        out.writeBytes(ParameterStringBuilder.getParamsString(parameters));
        out.flush();
        out.close();
```

- **Setting Request Headers**

Adding headers to a request can be achieved by using the setRequestProperty() method:
`con.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/json");`

To read the value of a header from a connection, we can use the getHeaderField() method:
`String contentType = con.getHeaderField("Content-Type");`
