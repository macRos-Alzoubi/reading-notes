# Intents, Activities, and SharedPreferences

## Tasks and the back stack

A task is a collection of activities that users interact with when trying to do something in your app. These activities are arranged in a stack—the back stack—in the order in which each activity is opened. For example, an email app might have one activity to show a list of new messages. When the user selects a message, a new activity opens to view that message. This new activity is added to the back stack. Then, if the user presses or gestures Back, that new activity is finished and popped off the stack.

### Lifecycle of a task and its back stack

The device Home screen is the starting place for most tasks. When a user touches the icon for an app or shortcut in the app launcher (or on the Home screen), that app's task comes to the foreground. If no task exists for the app (the app has not been used recently), then a new task is created and the main activity for that app opens as the root activity in the stack.

When the current activity starts another, the new activity is pushed on the top of the stack and takes focus. The previous activity remains in the stack, but is stopped. When an activity stops, the system retains the current state of its user interface. When the user performs the back action, the current activity is popped from the top of the stack (the activity is destroyed) and the previous activity resumes (the previous state of its UI is restored). Activities in the stack are never rearranged, only pushed and popped from the stack—pushed onto the stack when started by the current activity and popped off when the user leaves it using the Back button or gesture. As such, the back stack operates as a last in, first out object structure.

### Back press behavior for root launcher activities

Root launcher activities are activities that declare an Intent filter with both `ACTION_MAIN` and `CATEGORY_LAUNCHER`. These activities are unique because they act as entry points into your app from the app launcher and are used to start a task.

#### System behavior on Android 11 and lower

The system finishes the activity.

#### System behavior on Android 12 and higher

The system moves the activity and its task to the background instead of finishing the activity. This behavior matches the default system behavior when navigating out of an app using the Home button or gesture.

In most cases, this behavior means that users can more quickly resume your app from a `warm state`, instead of having to completely restart the app from a `cold state`.

### Background and foreground tasks

A task is a cohesive unit that can move to the background when a user begins a new task or goes to the Home screen. While in the background, all the activities in the task are stopped, but the back stack for the task remains intact—the task has simply lost focus while another task takes place, A task can then return to the foreground so users can pick up where they left off.

### Manage tasks

The way Android manages tasks and the back stack, as described above—by placing all activities started in succession in the same task and in a last in, first out stack—works great for most apps and you shouldn't have to worry about how your activities are associated with tasks or how they exist in the back stack. However, you might decide that you want to interrupt the normal behavior. Perhaps you want an activity in your app to begin a new task when it is started (instead of being placed within the current task); or, when you start an activity, you want to bring forward an existing instance of it (instead of creating a new instance on top of the back stack); or, you want your back stack to be cleared of all activities except for the root activity when the user leaves the task.

You can do these things and more, with attributes in the `<activity>` manifest element and with flags in the intent that you pass to `startActivity()`.

In this regard, these are the principal `<activity>` attributes that you can use:

- `taskAffinity`
- `launchMode`
- `allowTaskReparenting`
- `clearTaskOnLaunch`
- `alwaysRetainTaskState`
- `finishOnTaskLaunch`

And these are the principal `intent` flags that you can use:

- `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK`
- `FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP`
- `FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP`

### Defining launch modes

Launch modes allow you to define how a new instance of an activity is associated with the current task. You can define different launch modes in two ways:

- Using the manifest file

When you declare an activity in your manifest file, you can specify how the activity should associate with tasks when it starts.

- Using Intent flags

When you call `startActivity()`, you can include a flag in the Intent that declares how (or whether) the new activity should associate with the current task.

## Android SharedPreferences

### Save key-value data

If you have a relatively small collection of key-values that you'd like to save, you should use the `SharedPreferences` APIs. A `SharedPreferences` object points to a file containing key-value pairs and provides simple methods to read and write them. Each `SharedPreferences` file is managed by the `framework` and can be private or shared.

### Get a handle to shared preferences

You can create a new shared preference file or access an existing one by calling one of these methods:

- getSharedPreferences() — Use this if you need multiple shared preference files identified by name, which you specify with the first parameter. You can call this from any Context in your app.

- getPreferences() — Use this from an Activity if you need to use only one shared preference file for the activity. Because this retrieves a default shared preference file that belongs to the activity, you don't need to supply a name.

### Write to shared preferences

To write to a shared preferences file, create a `SharedPreferences`.Editor by calling `edit()` on your `SharedPreferences`.

Pass the keys and values you want to write with methods such as `putInt()` and `putString()`. Then call `apply()` or `commit()` to save the changes.

`apply()` changes the in-memory SharedPreferences object immediately but writes the updates to disk asynchronously. Alternatively, you can use `commit()` to write the data to disk synchronously. But because `commit()` is synchronous, you should avoid calling it from your main thread because it could pause your UI rendering.

### Read from shared preferences

To retrieve values from a shared preferences file, call methods such as `getInt()` and `getString()`, providing the key for the value you want, and optionally a default value to return if the key isn't present.
