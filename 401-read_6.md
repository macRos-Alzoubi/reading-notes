# Inheritance and Interfaces

## Java OO

- **What Is an Object?**

  Objects are key to understanding object-oriented technology. Look around right now and you'll find many examples of
  real-world objects: your dog, your desk, your television set, your bicycle.

  Real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior. Dogs have state (name, color, breed,
  hungry) and behavior (barking, fetching, wagging tail).

  Software objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects: they too consist of state and related behavior. An
  object stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages) and exposes its behavior through methods (
  functions in some programming languages). Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary
  mechanism for object-to-object communication. Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed
  through an object's methods is known as data encapsulation — a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.

- **What Is a Class?**

  In the real world, you'll often find many individual objects all of the same kind. There may be thousands of other
  bicycles in existence, all of the same make and model. Each bicycle was built from the same set of blueprints and
  therefore contains the same components. In object-oriented terms, we say that your bicycle is an instance of the class
  of objects known as bicycles. A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.

  ```java
  class Bicycle {
  
      int cadence = 0;
      int speed = 0;
      int gear = 1;
  
      void changeCadence(int newValue) {
           cadence = newValue;
      }
  
      void changeGear(int newValue) {
           gear = newValue;
      }
  
      void speedUp(int increment) {
           speed = speed + increment;   
      }
  
      void applyBrakes(int decrement) {
           speed = speed - decrement;
      }
  
      void printStates() {
           System.out.println("cadence:" +
               cadence + " speed:" + 
               speed + " gear:" + gear);
      }
  }
  ```

## Java Classes

- **Declaring Classes**

  ```java
  class MyClass {
    // field, constructor, and 
    // method declarations
  }
  ```

  This is a class declaration. The class body (the area between the braces) contains all the code that provides for the
  life cycle of the objects created from the class: constructors for initializing new objects, declarations for the
  fields that provide the state of the class and its objects, and methods to implement the behavior of the class and its
  objects.

- **Declaring Member Variables**

  There are several kinds of variables:

    - Member variables in a class—these are called fields.
    - Variables in a method or block of code—these are called local variables.
    - Variables in method declarations—these are called parameters.

  The Bicycle class uses the following lines of code to define its fields:

  ```java
    public int cadence;
    public int gear;
    public int speed;
  ```

  Field declarations are composed of three components, in order:

    1. Zero or more modifiers, such as public or private.
    2. The field's type.
    3. The field's name.

- **Access Modifiers**

  modifier used lets you control what other classes have access to a member field

    - `public` modifier—the field is accessible from all classes.
    - `private` modifier—the field is accessible only within its own class.

- **Types**

  All variables must have a type. You can use primitive types such as int, float, boolean, etc. Or you can use reference
  types, such as strings, arrays, or objects.

- **Variable Names**

  All variables, whether they are fields, local variables, or parameters, follow the same naming rules and conventions
  that were covered in the Language Basics lesson

    - the first letter of a class name should be capitalized, and
    - the first (or only) word in a method name should be a verb.

- **Defining Methods**

  Here is an example of a typical method declaration:

  ```java
    public double calculateAnswer(double wingSpan,int numberOfEngines,
          double length,double grossTons){
          //do the calculation here
          }
  ```

  The only required elements of a method declaration are the method's return type, name, a pair of parentheses, (), and
  a body between braces, {}.

  More generally, method declarations have six components, in order:

    1. Modifiers—such as `public`, `private`.
    2. The return type—the data type of the value returned by the method, or void if the method does not return a value.
    3. The method name—the rules for field names apply to method names as well, but the convention is a little
       different.
    4. The parameter list in parenthesis—a comma-delimited list of input parameters, preceded by their data types,
       enclosed by parentheses, (). If there are no parameters, you must use empty parentheses.
    5. An exception list.
    6. The method body, enclosed between braces—the method's code, including the declaration of local variables, goes
       here.

- **Naming a Method**

  Although a method name can be any legal identifier, code conventions restrict method names. By convention, method
  names should be a verb in lowercase or a multi-word name that begins with a verb in lowercase, followed by adjectives,
  nouns, etc. In multi-word names, the first letter of each of the second and following words should be capitalized.
  Here are some examples:

    - run
    - runFast
    - getBackground

- **Overloading Methods**

  Typically, a method has a unique name within its class. However, a method might have the same name as other methods
  due to method overloading.

  The Java programming language supports overloading methods, and Java can distinguish between methods with different
  method signatures. This means that methods within a class can have the same name if they have different parameter
  lists

- **Providing Constructors for Your Classes**

  A class contains constructors that are invoked to create objects from the class blueprint. Constructor declarations
  look like method declarations—except that they use the name of the class and have no return type.

  a constructor is called by the new operator.

  `new Bicycle(30, 0, 8)` creates space in memory for the object and initializes its fields.

  ```java
  public Bicycle() {
  gear = 1;
  cadence = 10;
  speed = 0;
  }
  ```

- **What Is Inheritance?**

  Different kinds of objects often have a certain amount in common with each other. Mountain bikes, road bikes, and
  tandem bikes, for example, all share the characteristics of bicycles (current speed, current pedal cadence, current
  gear). Yet each also defines additional features that make them different: tandem bicycles have two seats and two sets
  of handlebars; road bikes have drop handlebars; some mountain bikes have an additional chain ring, giving them a lower
  gear ratio.

  Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes. In this
  example, Bicycle now becomes the superclass of MountainBike, RoadBike, and TandemBike. In the Java programming
  language, each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited
  number of subclasses:

  ![Inheritance](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/figures/java/concepts-bikeHierarchy.gif)

  The syntax for creating a subclass is simple. At the beginning of your class declaration, use the extends keyword,
  followed by the name of the class to inherit from:

  ```java
    class MountainBike extends Bicycle {

    // new fields and methods defining 
    // a mountain bike would go here

  }
  ```

- **What Is an Interface?**

  In its most common form, an interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies. A bicycle's behavior, if
  specified as an interface, might appear as follows:

  ```java
  interface Bicycle {

    //  wheel revolutions per minute
    void changeCadence(int newValue);

    void changeGear(int newValue);

    void speedUp(int increment);

    void applyBrakes(int decrement);
  }
  ```

  To implement this interface, the name of your class would change (to a particular brand of bicycle, for example, such
  as ACMEBicycle), and you'd use the implements keyword in the class declaration:

  ```java
  class ACMEBicycle implements Bicycle {

    int cadence = 0;
    int speed = 0;
    int gear = 1;

   // The compiler will now require that methods
   // changeCadence, changeGear, speedUp, and applyBrakes
   // all be implemented. Compilation will fail if those
   // methods are missing from this class.

    void changeCadence(int newValue) {
         cadence = newValue;
    }

    void changeGear(int newValue) {
         gear = newValue;
    }

    void speedUp(int increment) {
         speed = speed + increment;   
    }

    void applyBrakes(int decrement) {
         speed = speed - decrement;
    }

    void printStates() {
         System.out.println("cadence:" +
             cadence + " speed:" + 
             speed + " gear:" + gear);
    }

  }
  ```

  Implementing an interface allows a class to become more formal about the behavior it promises to provide. Interfaces
  form a contract between the class and the outside world, and this contract is enforced at build time by the compiler.
  If your class claims to implement an interface, all methods defined by that interface must appear in its source code
  before the class will successfully compile.

- **What Is a Package?**

  A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. Conceptually you can think of
  packages as being similar to different folders on your computer.

  Because software written in the Java programming language can be composed of hundreds or thousands of individual
  classes, it makes sense to keep things organized by placing related classes and interfaces into packages.

  The Java platform provides an enormous class library (a set of packages) suitable for use in your own applications.
  This library is known as the "Application Programming Interface", or "API" for short. Its packages represent the tasks
  most commonly associated with general-purpose programming. For example, a String object contains state and behavior
  for character strings; a File object allows a programmer to easily create, delete, inspect, compare, or modify a file
  on the filesystem; a Socket object allows for the creation and use of network sockets; various GUI objects control
  buttons and check boxes and anything else related to graphical user interfaces. There are literally thousands of
  classes to choose from. This allows you, the programmer, to focus on the design of your particular application, rather
  than the infrastructure required to make it work.
