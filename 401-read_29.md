# Room

## Overview: Saving data with Room

### Save data in a local database using Room

Apps that handle non-trivial amounts of structured data can benefit greatly from persisting that data locally. The most common use case is to cache relevant pieces of data so that when the device cannot access the network, the user can still browse that content while they are offline.

The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. In particular, Room provides the following benefits:

- Compile-time verification of SQL queries.
- Convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.
- Streamlined database migration paths.

### Setup

To use Room in your app, add the following dependencies to your app's **build.gradle** file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    def room_version = "2.3.0"

    implementation "androidx.room:room-runtime:$room_version"
    annotationProcessor "androidx.room:room-compiler:$room_version"

    // optional - RxJava2 support for Room
    implementation "androidx.room:room-rxjava2:$room_version"

    // optional - RxJava3 support for Room
    implementation "androidx.room:room-rxjava3:$room_version"

    // optional - Guava support for Room, including Optional and ListenableFuture
    implementation "androidx.room:room-guava:$room_version"

    // optional - Test helpers
    testImplementation "androidx.room:room-testing:$room_version"

    // optional - Paging 3 Integration
    implementation "androidx.room:room-paging:2.4.0-beta01"
}
```

### Primary components

There are three major components in Room:

- The **database class** that holds the database and serves as the main access point for the underlying connection to your app's persisted data.
- **Data entities** that represent tables in your app's database.
- **Data access objects** (DAOs) that provide methods that your app can use to query, update, insert, and delete data in the database.

The database class provides your app with instances of the DAOs associated with that database. In turn, the app can use the DAOs to retrieve data from the database as instances of the associated data entity objects. The app can also use the defined data entities to update rows from the corresponding tables, or to create new rows for insertion.

### Sample implementation

#### Data entity

The following code defines a User data entity. Each instance of `User` represents a row in a `user` table in the app's database.

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @PrimaryKey
    public int uid;

    @ColumnInfo(name = "first_name")
    public String firstName;

    @ColumnInfo(name = "last_name")
    public String lastName;
}
```

#### Data access object 

The following code defines a `DAO` called `UserDao`. `UserDao` provides the methods that the rest of the app uses to interact with data in the user table.

```java
@Dao
public interface UserDao {
    @Query("SELECT * FROM user")
    List<User> getAll();

    @Query("SELECT * FROM user WHERE uid IN (:userIds)")
    List<User> loadAllByIds(int[] userIds);

    @Query("SELECT * FROM user WHERE first_name LIKE :first AND " +
           "last_name LIKE :last LIMIT 1")
    User findByName(String first, String last);

    @Insert
    void insertAll(User... users);

    @Delete
    void delete(User user);
}
```

#### Database

The following code defines an `AppDatabase` class to hold the database. `AppDatabase` defines the database configuration and serves as the app's main access point to the persisted data. The database class must satisfy the following conditions:

- The class must be annotated with a `@Database` annotation that includes an entities array that lists all of the data entities associated with the database.
- The class must be an abstract class that extends `RoomDatabase`.
- For each `DAO` class that is associated with the `database`, the `database` class must define an abstract method that has zero arguments and returns an instance of the DAO class.

```java
@Database(entities = {User.class}, version = 1)
public abstract class AppDatabase extends RoomDatabase {
    public abstract UserDao userDao();
}
```

#### Usage

After you have defined the data entity, the `DAO`, and the database object, you can use the following code to create an instance of the `database`:

```java
AppDatabase db = Room.databaseBuilder(getApplicationContext(),
        AppDatabase.class, "database-name").build();
```

You can then use the abstract methods from the AppDatabase to get an instance of the DAO. In turn, you can use the methods from the DAO instance to interact with the database:

```java
UserDao userDao = db.userDao();
List<User> users = userDao.getAll();
```

## Defining data using Room entities

### Anatomy of an entity

You define each Room entity as a class that is annotated with `@Entity`. A Room entity includes fields for each column in the corresponding table in the database, including one or more columns that comprise the primary key.

The following code is an example of a simple entity that defines a User table with columns for `ID`, `first name`, and `last name`:

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @PrimaryKey
    public int id;

    public String firstName;
    public String lastName;
}
```

By default, Room uses the class name as the database table name. If you want the table to have a different name, set the tableName property of the `@Entity` annotation. Similarly, Room uses the field names as column names in the database by default. If you want a column to have a different name, add the `@ColumnInfo` annotation to the field and set the name property. The following example demonstrates custom names for tables and columns:

```java
@Entity(tableName = "users")
public class User {
    @PrimaryKey
    public int id;

    @ColumnInfo(name = "first_name")
    public String firstName;

    @ColumnInfo(name = "last_name")
    public String lastName;
}
```

### Define a primary key

***Note***: If you need Room to assign automatic IDs to entity instances, set the `autoGenerate` property of `@PrimaryKey` to `true`.

#### Define a composite primary key

If you need instances of an entity to be uniquely identified by a **combination of multiple columns**, you can define a **composite primary key** by listing those columns in the `primaryKeys` property of `@Entity`:

```java
@Entity(primaryKeys = {"firstName", "lastName"})
public class User {
    public String firstName;
    public String lastName;
}
```

### Ignore fields

By default, Room creates a column for each field that's defined in the entity. If an entity has fields that you don't want to persist, you can annotate them using `@Ignore`.

In cases where an entity `inherits` fields from a parent entity, it's usually easier to use the `ignoredColumns` property of the `@Entity` attribute:
