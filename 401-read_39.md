## Amplify and Kinesis

### Getting started

The Analytics category enables you to collect analytics data for your App. The Analytics category comes with built-in support for Amazon Pinpoint and Amazon Kinesis (Kinesis support is currently only available in the Amplify JavaScript library).

### Goal

To setup and configure your application with Amplify Analytics and record an analytics event.

### Prerequisites

An Android application targeting Android API level 16 (Android 4.1) or above

### Set up Analytics backend

Run the following command in your project's root folder. The CLI will prompt configuration options for the Analytics category such as Amazon Pinpoint resource name and analytics event settings.

`amplify add analytics`

```bash
? Select an Analytics provider (Use arrow keys)
    `Amazon Pinpoint`
? Provide your pinpoint resource name:
    `yourPinpointResourceName`
? Apps need authorization to send analytics events. Do you want to allow guests and unauthenticated users to send analytics events? (we recommend you allow this when getting started)
    `Yes
```

To deploy your backend, run:

`amplify push`

Upon completion, amplifyconfiguration.json should be updated to reference provisioned backend analytics resources.

### Install Amplify Libraries

Expand **Gradle Scripts**, open `build.gradle (Module: app)`. You will already have configured Amplify by following the steps in the Project Setup walkthrough.

Add Analytics by adding these libraries into the dependencies block:

```gradle
dependencies {
    // Add these lines in `dependencies`
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-analytics-pinpoint:1.29.0'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:1.29.0'
}
```

### Initialize Amplify Analytics

To initialize the Amplify Auth and Analytics categories you call `Amplify.addPlugin()` method for each category. To complete initialization call `Amplify.configure()`.

Add the following code to your `onCreate()` method in your application class:

```java
Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSCognitoAuthPlugin());
Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSPinpointAnalyticsPlugin(this));
```

Your class will look like this:

```java
public class MyAmplifyApp extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();

        try {
            // Add these lines to add the AWSCognitoAuthPlugin and AWSPinpointAnalyticsPlugin plugins
            Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSCognitoAuthPlugin());
            Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSPinpointAnalyticsPlugin(this));
            Amplify.configure(getApplicationContext());

            Log.i("MyAmplifyApp", "Initialized Amplify");
        } catch (AmplifyException error) {
            Log.e("MyAmplifyApp", "Could not initialize Amplify", error);
        }
    }
}
```

### Record events

To record an event, create an **AnalyticsEvent** and call `Amplify.Analytics.recordEvent()` to send it:

```java
AnalyticsEvent event = AnalyticsEvent.builder()
    .name("PasswordReset")
    .addProperty("Channel", "SMS")
    .addProperty("Successful", true)
    .addProperty("ProcessDuration", 792)
    .addProperty("UserAge", 120.3)
    .build();

Amplify.Analytics.recordEvent(event);
```

### View Analytics console

From the terminal run the following command.

`amplify console analytics`

Next Steps:

Congratulations! Now that you have Analytics' backend provisioned and Analytics library installed.
