# S3

## Introduction to Amazon S3

### What is Amazon S3?

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides management features so that you can optimize, organize, and configure access to your data to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.

### Features of Amazon S3

#### Storage classes

Amazon S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases. For example, you can store mission-critical production data in S3 Standard for frequent access, save costs by storing infrequently accessed data in S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA, and archive data at the lowest costs in S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

#### Storage management

Amazon S3 has storage management features that you can use to manage costs, meet regulatory requirements, reduce latency, and save multiple distinct copies of your data for compliance requirements.

#### Access management

Amazon S3 provides features for auditing and managing access to your buckets and objects. By default, S3 buckets and the objects in them are private. You have access only to the S3 resources that you create. 

#### Data processing

To transform data and trigger workflows to automate a variety of other processing activities at scale, you can use the following features.

- **S3 Object Lambda** – Add your own code to S3 GET requests to modify and process data as it is returned to an application. Filter rows, dynamically resize images, redact confidential data, and much more.
- **Event notifications** – Trigger workflows that use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), and AWS Lambda when a change is made to your S3 resources.

#### Storage logging and monitoring

Amazon S3 provides logging and monitoring tools that you can use to monitor and control how your Amazon S3 resources are being used.

#### Analytics and insights

Amazon S3 offers features to help you gain visibility into your storage usage, which empowers you to better understand, analyze, and optimize your storage at scale.

#### Strong consistency

Amazon S3 provides strong read-after-write consistency for PUT and DELETE requests of objects in your Amazon S3 bucket in all AWS Regions. This behavior applies to both writes of new objects as well as PUT requests that overwrite existing objects and DELETE requests. In addition, read operations on Amazon S3 Select, Amazon S3 access control lists (ACLs), Amazon S3 Object Tags, and object metadata (for example, the HEAD object) are strongly consistent. For more information, see Amazon S3 data consistency model.

### How Amazon S3 works

Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets. An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file. A bucket is a container for objects.

To store your data in Amazon S3, you first create a bucket and specify a bucket name and AWS Region. Then, you upload your data to that bucket as objects in Amazon S3. Each object has a key (or key name), which is the unique identifier for the object within the bucket.

## S3 with Amplify

The Amplify Storage category provides an interface for managing user content for your app in public, protected, or private storage buckets. The Storage category comes with default built-in support for Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). The Amplify CLI helps you to create and configure the storage buckets for your app. The Amplify AWS S3 Storage plugin leverages Amazon S3.

To setup and configure your application with Amplify Storage and go through a simple upload file example

### Prerequisites

- An Android application targeting Android API level 16 (Android 4.1) or above

### Provision backend storage

To start provisioning storage resources in the backend, go to your project directory and execute the command:

`amplify add storage`

Enter the following when prompted:

```bash
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services:
    `Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)`
? You need to add auth (Amazon Cognito) to your project in order to add storage for user files. Do you want to add auth now?
    `Yes`
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration?
    `Default configuration`
? How do you want users to be able to sign in?
    `Username`
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?
    `No, I am done.`
? Please provide a friendly name for your resource that will be used to label this category in the project:
    `S3friendlyName`
? Please provide bucket name:
    `storagebucketname`
? Who should have access:
    `Auth and guest users`
? What kind of access do you want for Authenticated users?
    `create/update, read, delete`
? What kind of access do you want for Guest users?
    `create/update, read, delete`
? Do you want to add a Lambda Trigger for your S3 Bucket?
    `No`
```

To push your changes to the cloud, execute the command:

`amplify push`

Upon completion, **amplifyconfiguration.json** will be updated to reference a newly provisioned S3 bucket. Note that this file should already be a part of your project.

### Install Amplify Libraries

Expand Gradle Scripts, open build.gradle (Module: app). You will already have configured Amplify by following the steps in the Project Setup walkthrough.

Add these libraries into the dependencies block:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-storage-s3:1.29.0'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:1.29.0'
}
```

aws-auth-cognito is used to provide authentication for Amazon S3.

### Initialize Amplify Storage

To initialize the Amplify Auth and Storage categories you call Amplify.addPlugin() method for each category. To complete initialization call `Amplify.configure()`.

Add the following code to your `onCreate()` method in your application class:

```gradle
Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSCognitoAuthPlugin());
Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSS3StoragePlugin());
``

Your class will look like this:

```java
public class MyAmplifyApp extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();

        try {
            // Add these lines to add the AWSCognitoAuthPlugin and AWSS3StoragePlugin plugins
            Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSCognitoAuthPlugin());
            Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSS3StoragePlugin());
            Amplify.configure(getApplicationContext());

            Log.i("MyAmplifyApp", "Initialized Amplify");
        } catch (AmplifyException error) {
            Log.e("MyAmplifyApp", "Could not initialize Amplify", error);
        }
    }
}

```

Note that because the storage category requires auth, you will need to either configure guest access or sign in a user before using features in the storage category.

### Uploading data to your bucket

To upload to S3 from a data object, specify the key and the data object to be uploaded.

```java
private void uploadFile() {
    File exampleFile = new File(getApplicationContext().getFilesDir(), "ExampleKey");

    try {
        BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(exampleFile));
        writer.append("Example file contents");
        writer.close();
    } catch (Exception exception) {
        Log.e("MyAmplifyApp", "Upload failed", exception);
    }

    Amplify.Storage.uploadFile(
            "ExampleKey",
            exampleFile,
            result -> Log.i("MyAmplifyApp", "Successfully uploaded: " + result.getKey()),
            storageFailure -> Log.e("MyAmplifyApp", "Upload failed", storageFailure)
    );
}
```

Upon successfully executing this code, you should see a new folder in your bucket, called public. It should contain a file called ExampleKey, whose contents is Example file contents.
