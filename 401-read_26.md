# Android Fundamentals

## Application Fundamentals

Android apps can be written using **Kotlin**, **Java**, and **C++** languages. The Android SDK tools compile your code along with any data and resource files into an APK or an Android App Bundle.

An Android package, which is an archive file with an .apk suffix, contains the contents of an Android app that are required at runtime and it is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app.

An Android App Bundle, which is an archive file with an .aab suffix, contains the contents of an Android app project including some additional metadata that is not required at runtime. An AAB is a publishing format and is not installable on Android devices, it defers APK generation and signing to a later stage. When distributing your app through Google Play for example, Google Play's servers generate optimized APKs that contain only the resources and code that are required by a particular device that is requesting installation of the app.

Each Android app lives in its own security sandbox, protected by the following Android security features:

- The Android operating system is a multi-user Linux system in which each app is a different user.
- By default, the system assigns each app a unique Linux user ID (the ID is used only by the system and is unknown to the app). The system sets permissions for all the files in an app so that only the user ID assigned to that app can access them.
- Each process has its own virtual machine (VM), so an app's code runs in isolation from other apps.
- By default, every app runs in its own Linux process. The Android system starts the process when any of the app's components need to be executed, and then shuts down the process when it's no longer needed or when the system must recover memory for other apps.

## App components

App components are the essential building blocks of an Android app. Each component is an entry point through which the system or a user can enter your app. Some components depend on others.

There are four different types of app components:

- Activities
- Services
- Broadcast receivers
- Content providers

### Activities

An activity is the entry point for interacting with the user. It represents a single screen with a user interface.

Although the activities work together to form a cohesive user experience in the email app, each one is independent of the others.

### Services

A service is a general-purpose entry point for keeping an app running in the background for all kinds of reasons. It is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes. A service does not provide a user interface.

 There are actually two very distinct semantics services tell the system about how to manage an app: Started services tell the system to keep them running until their work is completed.

 A service is implemented as a `subclass` of `Service`. 

### Broadcast receivers

A broadcast receiver is a component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements. 

A broadcast receiver is implemented as a subclass of `BroadcastReceiver` and each broadcast is delivered as an `Intent` object.

### Content providers

A content provider manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access. Through the content provider, other apps can query or modify the data if the content provider allows it. 

A content provider is implemented as a subclass of `ContentProvider` and must implement a standard set of `APIs` that enable other apps to perform transactions. 

### Activating components

Three of the four component types—activities, services, and broadcast receivers—are activated by an `asynchronous` message called an intent. Intents bind individual components to each other at runtime. You can think of them as the messengers that request an action from other components, whether the component belongs to your app or another.

An intent is created with an `Intent` object, which defines a message to activate either a specific component (explicit intent) or a specific type of component (implicit intent).
