# Cognito

## AUTHENTICATION

### Getting started

The Amplify Auth category provides an interface for authenticating a user. Behind the scenes, it provides the necessary authorization to the other Amplify categories. It comes with default, built-in support for Amazon **Cognito** User Pool and Identity Pool. The Amplify CLI helps you to create and configure the auth category with an authentication provider.

### Goal

To setup and configure your application with Amplify Auth and go through a simple api to check the current auth session

### Prerequisites

An Android application targeting at least Android **SDK API level 16** with Amplify libraries integrated

### Configure Auth Category

To start provisioning auth resources in the backend, go to your project directory and execute the command:
`amplify add auth`

Enter the following when prompted:

```bash
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration?
    `Default configuration`
? How do you want users to be able to sign in?
    `Username`
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?
    `No, I am done.`
```

To push your changes to the cloud, execute the command:

`amplify push`

Upon completion, `amplifyconfiguration.json` should be updated to reference provisioned backend auth resources. Note that these files should already be a part of your project if you followed the Project setup walkthrough.

### Install Amplify Libraries

Add the following dependency to your app's `build.gradle` along with others you added above in Prerequisites and click "Sync Now" when prompted:

```json
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:1.28.3'
}
```

### Initialize Amplify Auth

Add the Auth plugin before calling Amplify.configure. Update the code you added in Prerequisites:

```java
// Add this line, to include the Auth plugin.
Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSCognitoAuthPlugin());
Amplify.configure(getApplicationContext());
```

### Check the current auth session

We can now check the current auth session.

For testing purposes, you can run this from your MainActivity's onCreate method.

```java
Amplify.Auth.fetchAuthSession(
    result -> Log.i("AmplifyQuickstart", result.toString()),
    error -> Log.e("AmplifyQuickstart", error.toString())
);
```

The isSignedIn property of the authSession will be false since we haven't signed in to the category yet.
