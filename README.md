#Growth Mindset Explanation
**[Growth](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)**: 
Believing that one's fundamentals abilities like ***intelligence*** and ***talent*** can be
developed through *hard-working* and *practicing*, A growth mindset is synonymous with
a love of learning which means
the more you love to learn something the more you try and practice
to be good at it (no pain no gain :face_with_head_bandage:).

**fixed mindset**:
which is the opposite of a Growth Mindset, It believes that oneâ€™s fundamental
abilities like ***intelligence*** and ***talent*** can't be developed,
Suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone,
Without the need for further development or effort.
