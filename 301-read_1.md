## Component Based Architecture

**Component-based architecture** focuses on the decomposition of the design into individual functional or logical components that represent well-defined communication interfaces containing methods, events, and properties. It provides a higher level of abstraction and divides the problem into sub-problems, each associated with component partitions.

### What is a Component?

A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

### What are the charactistics of a component?

- #### Reusability

    Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

- #### Replaceable

    Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- #### Not context specific

    Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- #### Extensible

    A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

- #### Encapsulated

    A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

- #### Independent

    Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

### What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

- #### Ease of deployment

     As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

- #### Reduced cost

    The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

- #### Ease of development

    Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

- #### Reusable

    The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

- #### Modification of technical complexity

    A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

- #### Reliability

    The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

- #### System maintenance and evolution

    Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

- #### Independent

    Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

## Props

### What is props short for?

React is a component-based library which divides the UI into little reusable pieces. In some cases, those components need to communicate (send data to each other) and the way to pass data between components is by using props.
“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.
But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)
Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.

### How are props used in React?

1. Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)

    We already know that we can assign attributes and values to HTML tags:

    `<a href="www.google.com">Click here to visit Google</a>;`

    Likewise, we can do the same for React components. We can define our own attributes & assign values with **interpolation { }**:

   `<ChildComponent someAttribute={value} anotherAttribute={value}/>`

   Here I’m declaring a “text” attribute to the ChildComponent and then assign a string value: “I’m the 1st child”.

   `<ChildComponent text={“I’m the 1st child”} />`

   Now the ChildComponent has a property and a value. Next, we need to pass it via Props.

2. Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props

    Passing props is very simple. Like we pass arguments to a function, we pass props into a React component and props bring all the necessary data.
    Arguments passed to a function:

    ```React
        const addition = (firstNum, secondNum) => {  
        return firstNum + secondNum; 
        };
    ```

    Arguments passed to a React component:

    ```React
        const ChildComponent = (props) => {  
        return <p>I'm the 1st child!</p>; 
        };
    ```

3. Finally, render the Props Data

In the final step, we will render the props object by using string interpolation:
`{props}`

Props returns back an object. In JavaScript, we can access to object elements with dot(.) notation. So, let’s render our text property with interpolation:

```React
    const ChildComponent = (props) => {  
    return <p>{props.text}</p>; 
    };
```

### What is the flow of props?

Props can only be passed to components in one-way (parent to child).
