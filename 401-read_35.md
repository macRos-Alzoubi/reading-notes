# Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of **vertices** (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named **edges**.

- terminology used when working with Graphs:

- **Vertex** - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- **Edge** - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- **Neighbor** - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- **Degree** - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Directed vs Undirected

An **Undirected Graph** is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

For example, in the graph below, Node **C** is connected to Node **A**, Node **E** and Node **B**. There are no “directions” given to point to specific vertices. The connection is bi-directional.

The undirected graph we are looking at has 6 vertices and 7 undirected edges.

`Vertices/Nodes = {a,b,c,d,e,f}`

`Edges = {(a,c),(a,d),(b,c),(b,f),(c,e),(d,e),(e,f)}`

## Directed Graphs (Digraph)

A **Directed Graph** also called a **Digraph** is a graph where every edge is directed.

Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

The directed graph above has six vertices and eight directed edges

`Vertices = {a,b,c,d,e,f}`

`Edges = {(a,c),(b,c),(b,f),(c,e),(d,a),(d,e)(e,c)(e,f)}`

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

There are many different types of graphs. This depends on how connected the graphs are to other node/vertices.

The three different types are completed, connected, and disconnected.

### Complete Graphs

A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

### Connected

A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

### Disconnected

A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

## Acyclic vs Cyclic

In addition to undirected and directed graphs, we also have acyclic and cyclic graphs.

### Acyclic Graph

An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.

Here is an example of 3 acyclic graphs:

![Acyclic Graph](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/assets/threeAcyclic.png)

A directed acyclic graph is also called a DAG. This can also be represented as what we know as a tree.

## Cyclic Graphs

A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.

A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.

Here is an example of a two different cyclic graph:

## Graph Representation

We represent graphs through:

Adjacency Matrix

1. Adjacency List
2. We will represent the following graph as both an Adjacency Matrix and an Adjacency List:

## Adjacency Matrix

An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix

Each Row and column represents each vertex of the data structure. The elements of both the column and the row must add up to 1 if there is an edge that connects the two, or zero if there isn’t a connection.

This is what an adjacency matrix looks like:

![](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/assets/AdjMatrix.PNG)

A few things to note from the above:

1. Looking at the graph we are representing, you can see that `Vertex A` connects to both `Vertex D` and `Vertex C`. To show this, we place a 1 in the position of `(a,c) and (a,d)`.
2. We follow this same pattern for the other vertex’s and where they are connected.
3. If there is not an **edge/connection** between the vertex’s, we represent this by placing a 0 in the appropriate point of the matrix.

a `sparse graph` is when there are very **few connections**. a `dense graph` is when there are **many connections**.

## Adjacency List

An adjacency list is the most common way to represent graphs.

An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.

Adjacency lists make it easy to view if one vertices connects to another.

This is what an Adjacency List looks like:

![](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/assets/AdjList.PNG)

Looking at the original graph that we are representing, we can see that Vertex A has an edge to both Vertex C and Vertex D. As a result, we will place both Vertex C and Vertex D in the adjacency list. Just from observation, we can see that we will only place the vertices that are connected in the list. If there is no connection between the vertices, they are not listed.

Thinking about how we will implement this in code? Well, let’s look at what the visual is telling us.

1. We can visually see that we are working with a collection of some sort. The visual is depicting a Linked List, but you could easily make it an array of arrays if you’d like.
2. Each index or node (depending on the data structure you choose to represent the adjacency list) will be a vertex within the graph.
3. Every time you add an edge, you will find the appropriate vertices in the data structure and add it to the appropriate location.

## Weighted Graphs

A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights. This is what a weighted graph looks like:
