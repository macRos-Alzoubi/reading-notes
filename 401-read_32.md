# Serverless and Amplify

## Intro to Serverless

### Focus on your application, not the infrastructure

Sounds relieving though, knowing a lot of your daylight hours go into implementing, maintaining, debugging, and monitoring the infrastructure. With all of that infrastructure heavy lifting out of the way, we really can focus on the business goals our applications serve. A lot of productive efforts could be channeled in the right direction, where they were meant to be ideally. Maybe it sounds too good to be true, but this is the way things should have been. At least for those of you who cant afford to spend a lot of time caught up in the web of intricacies in modern complex infrastructure.

### So, What is Serverless?

Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider. Pricing is based on the number of executions rather than pre-purchased compute capacity.

## AWS Amplify Kool-Aid

### How it works

AWS Amplify is a set of purpose-built tools and services that makes it quick and easy for front-end web and mobile developers build full-stack applications on AWS, with the flexibility to leverage the breadth of AWS services to further customize applications. Amplify supports popular languages, frameworks, and platforms, including `JavaScript`, `React`, `Angular`, `Vue`, and `Next.js` for web apps and `Android`, `iOS`, `React Native`, `Ionic`, and `Flutter` for mobile apps.

## GraphQL

### Overview

The GraphQL Transform provides a simple to use abstraction that helps you quickly create backends for your web and mobile applications on AWS. With the GraphQL Transform, you define your application's data model using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) and the library handles converting your SDL definition into a set of fully descriptive AWS CloudFormation templates that implement your data model.

For example you might create the backend for a blog like this:

```java
type Blog @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  posts: [Post] @connection(name: "BlogPosts")
}
type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  blog: Blog @connection(name: "BlogPosts")
  comments: [Comment] @connection(name: "PostComments")
}
type Comment @model {
  id: ID!
  content: String
  post: Post @connection(name: "PostComments")
}
```

The GraphQL Transform simplifies the process of developing, deploying, and maintaining GraphQL APIs. With it, you define your API using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) and can then use automation to transform it into a fully descriptive cloudformation template that implements the spec. The transform also provides a framework through which you can define your own transformers as @directives for custom workflows.

### Create a GraphQL API

Navigate into the root of a JavaScript, iOS, or Android project and run:

`amplify init`

Follow the wizard to create a new app. After finishing the wizard run:

`amplify add api`

Select the following options:

- Select GraphQL
- When asked if you have a schema, say No
- Select one of the default samples; you can change this later
- Choose to edit the schema and it will open the new schema.
graphql in your editor

You can leave the sample as is or try this schema.

```java
type Blog @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  posts: [Post] @connection(name: "BlogPosts")
}
type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  blog: Blog @connection(name: "BlogPosts")
  comments: [Comment] @connection(name: "PostComments")
}
type Comment @model {
  id: ID!
  content: String
  post: Post @connection(name: "PostComments")
}
```

Once you are happy with your schema, save the file and hit enter in your terminal window. if no error messages are thrown this means the transformation was successful and you can deploy your new API.

`amplify push`

### Test the API

Once the API is finished deploying, go to the AWS AppSync console or run amplify mock api to try some of these queries in your new API's query page.

```java
# Create a blog. Remember the returned id.
# Provide the returned id as the "blogId" variable.
mutation CreateBlog {
  createBlog(input: {
    name: "My New Blog!"
  }) {
    id
    name
  }
}

# Create a post and associate it with the blog via the "postBlogId" input field.
# Provide the returned id as the "postId" variable.
mutation CreatePost($blogId:ID!) {
  createPost(input:{title:"My Post!", postBlogId: $blogId}) {
    id
    title
    blog {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}

# Provide the returned id from the CreateBlog mutation as the "blogId" variable
# in the "variables" pane (bottom left pane) of the query editor:
{
  "blogId": "returned-id-goes-here"
}

# Create a comment and associate it with the post via the "commentPostId" input field.
mutation CreateComment($postId:ID!) {
  createComment(input:{content:"A comment!", commentPostId:$postId}) {
    id
    content
    post {
      id
      title
      blog {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}

# Provide the returned id from the CreatePost mutation as the "postId" variable
# in the "variables" pane (bottom left pane) of the query editor:
{
  "postId": "returned-id-goes-here"
}

# Get a blog, its posts, and its posts' comments.
query GetBlog($blogId:ID!) {
  getBlog(id:$blogId) {
    id
    name
    posts(filter: {
      title: {
        eq: "My Post!"
      }
    }) {
      items {
        id
        title
        comments {
          items {
            id
            content
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

# List all blogs, their posts, and their posts' comments.
query ListBlogs {
  listBlogs { # Try adding: listBlog(filter: { name: { eq: "My New Blog!" } })
    items {
      id
      name
      posts { # or try adding: posts(filter: { title: { eq: "My Post!" } })
        items {
          id
          title
          comments { # and so on ...
            items {
              id
              content
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Update schema

If you want to update your API, open your project's backend/api/~apiname~/schema.graphql file (NOT the one in the backend/api/~apiname~/build folder) and edit it in your favorite code editor. You can compile the backend/api/~apiname~/schema.graphql by running:

`amplify api gql-compile`

and view the compiled schema output in backend/api/~apiname~/build/schema.graphql.

You can then push updated changes with:

`amplify push`
