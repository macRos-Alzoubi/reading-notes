# Related Resources and Integration Testing

## Working with Relationships in Spring Data REST

### One-to-One Relationship

1. #### The Data Model

Let's define two entity classes Library and Address having a one-to-one relationship, using the @OneToOne annotation.
The association is owned by the Library end of the association:

```java

@Entity
public class Library {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;

    @Column
    private String name;

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "address_id")
    @RestResource(path = "libraryAddress", rel = "address")
    private Address address;

    // standard constructor, getters, setters
}

@Entity
public class Address {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String location;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "address")
    private Library library;

    // standard constructor, getters, setters
}
```

The @RestResource annotation is optional and can be used to customize the endpoint.

We must be careful to have different names for each association resource. Otherwise, we will encounter a
JsonMappingException with the message: “Detected multiple association links with same relation type! Disambiguate
association”.

The association name defaults to the property name and can be customized using the rel attribute of @RestResource
annotation:

```java
@OneToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "secondary_address_id")
@RestResource(path = "libraryAddress", rel = "address")
private Address secondaryAddress;
```

If we were to add the secondaryAddress property above to the Library class, we would have two resources named address,
and we would encounter a conflict.

We can resolve this by specifying a different value for the rel attribute or by omitting the RestResource annotation so
that the resource name defaults to secondaryAddress.

2. #### The Repositories

In order to expose these entities as resources, let's create two repository interfaces for each of them, by extending
the CrudRepository interface:

`public interface LibraryRepository extends CrudRepository<Library, Long> {}`
`public interface AddressRepository extends CrudRepository<Address, Long> {}`

3. #### Creating the Resources

First, let's add a Library instance to work with:

`curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json"
-d '{"name":"My Library"}' http://localhost:8080/libraries`

The API returns the JSON object:

```json
{
  "name": "My Library",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/libraries/1"
    },
    "library": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/libraries/1"
    },
    "address": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/libraries/1/libraryAddress"
    }
  }
}
```

Before we create an association, sending a GET request to this endpoint will return an empty object.

However, if we want to add an association, we must first create an Address instance also:

`curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json"
-d '{"location":"Main Street nr 5"}' http://localhost:8080/addresses`

The result of the POST request is a JSON object containing the Address record:

```json
{
  "location": "Main Street nr 5",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/addresses/1"
    },
    "address": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/addresses/1"
    },
    "library": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/addresses/1/library"
    }
  }
}
```

4. #### Creating the Associations

After persisting both instances, we can establish the relationship by using one of the association resources.

This is done using the HTTP method PUT, which supports a media type of text/uri-list, and a body containing the URI of
the resource to bind to the association.

Since the Library entity is the owner of the association, let's add an address to a library:

`curl -i -X PUT -d "http://localhost:8080/addresses/1"
-H "Content-Type:text/uri-list" http://localhost:8080/libraries/1/libraryAddress`

If successful, this returns status 204. To verify, let's check the library association resource of the address:

`curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/addresses/1/library`

This should return the Library JSON object with name “My Library”.

To remove an association, we can call the endpoint with DELETE method, making sure to use the association resource of
the owner of the relationship:

`curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/libraries/1/libraryAddress`

### One-to-Many Relationship

A one-to-many relationship is defined using the `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToOne` annotations and can have the optional
`@RestResource` annotation to customize the association resource.

1. #### The Data Model

To exemplify a one-to-many relationship, let's add a new Book entity that will represent the “many” end of a
relationship with the Library entity:

```java

@Entity
public class Book {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String title;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "library_id")
    private Library library;

    // standard constructor, getter, setter
}
```

Let's add the relationship to the Library class as well:

```java
public class Library {

    //...

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "library")
    private List<Book> books;

    //...

}
```

3. #### The Repository

`public interface BookRepository extends CrudRepository<Book, Long> { }`

4. #### The Association Resources

In order to add a book to a library, we need to create a Book instance first by using the /books collection resource:

`curl -i -X POST -d "{\"title\":\"Book1\"}"
-H "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:8080/books`

And here is the response from the POST request:

```json
{
  "title": "Book1",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/books/1"
    },
    "book": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/books/1"
    },
    "bookLibrary": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/books/1/library"
    }
  }
}
```

In the response body, we can see the association endpoint /books/{bookId}/library has been created.

Let's associate the book with the library created in the previous section by sending a PUT request to the association
resource that contains the URI of the library resource:

`curl -i -X PUT -H "Content-Type:text/uri-list"
-d "http://localhost:8080/libraries/1" http://localhost:8080/books/1/library`

We can verify the books in the library by using GET method on the library's /books association resource:

`curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/libraries/1/books`

### Many-to-Many Relationship

A many-to-many relationship is defined using `@ManyToMany` annotation, to which we can add `@RestResource`.

1. #### The Data Model

To create an example of a many-to-many relationship, let's add a new model class Author that will have a many-to-many
relationship with the Book entity:

```java

@Entity
public class Author {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String name;

    @ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinTable(name = "book_author",
            joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "book_id", referencedColumnName = "id"),
            inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "author_id",
                    referencedColumnName = "id"))
    private List<Book> books;

    //standard constructors, getters, setters
}
```

Let's add the association in the Book class as well:

```java
public class Book {

    //...

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "books")
    private List<Author> authors;

    //...
}
```

2. #### The Repository

`public interface AuthorRepository extends CrudRepository<Author, Long> { }`

3. #### The Association Resources

As in the previous sections, we must first create the resources before we can establish the association.

Let's first create an Author instance by sending a POST requests to the /authors collection resource:

`curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json"
-d "{\"name\":\"author1\"}" http://localhost:8080/authors`

Next, let's add a second Book record to our database:

`curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json"
-d "{\"title\":\"Book 2\"}" http://localhost:8080/books`

Now we can create an association between the two Book records and the Author record using the endpoint authors/1/books
with PUT method, which supports a media type of text/uri-list and can receive more than one URI.

To send multiple URIs we have to separate them by a line break:

`curl -i -X PUT -H "Content-Type:text/uri-list"
--data-binary @uris.txt http://localhost:8080/authors/1/books`

## Integration Testing in Spring

### Spring MVC Test Configuration

1. #### Enable Spring in Tests with JUnit 5

JUnit 5 defines an extension interface through which classes can integrate with the JUnit test.

We can enable this extension by adding the @ExtendWith annotation to our test classes and specifying the extension class
to load. To run the Spring test, we use SpringExtension.class.

We also need the @ContextConfiguration annotation to load the context configuration and bootstrap the context that our
test will use.

```java

@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
@ContextConfiguration(classes = {ApplicationConfig.class})
@WebAppConfiguration
public class GreetControllerIntegrationTest {
    ....
}
```

Notice how, in @ContextConfiguration, we provide the ApplicationConfig.class config class, which loads the configuration
we need for this particular test.

2. #### The WebApplicationContext Object

WebApplicationContext provides a web application configuration. It loads all the application beans and controllers into
the context.

We'll now be able to wire the web application context right into the test:

`@Autowired private WebApplicationContext webApplicationContext;`

3. #### Mocking Web Context Beans

MockMvc provides support for Spring MVC testing. It encapsulates all web application beans and makes them available for
testing.

```java
private MockMvc mockMvc;
@BeforeEach
public void setup()throws Exception{
        this.mockMvc=MockMvcBuilders.webAppContextSetup(this.webApplicationContext).build();
        }
```

4. #### Verify Test Configuration

Let's verify that we're loading the WebApplicationContext object (webApplicationContext) properly. We'll also check that
the right servletContext is being attached:

```java
@Test
public void givenWac_whenServletContext_thenItProvidesGreetController() {
    ServletContext servletContext = webApplicationContext.getServletContext();
    
    Assert.assertNotNull(servletContext);
    Assert.assertTrue(servletContext instanceof MockServletContext);
    Assert.assertNotNull(webApplicationContext.getBean("greetController"));
}
```
