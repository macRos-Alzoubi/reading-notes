# Passing Functions as Props

## lists and keys

### - What does .map() return?

Return an array of the same length of the orginal array reflicting the `map()` method body.

### - If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

We can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces `{}`.

i.g:

```JSX
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li>{number}</li>
);
```

We include the entire listItems array inside a `<ul>` element, and render it to the `DOM`:

i.g:

```JSX
ReactDOM.render(
  <ul>{listItems}</ul>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### - Each list item needs a unique ____

Each list item needs a unique ***Key***.

### - What is the purpose of a key?

**Keys** help `React` identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.

## The Spread Operator

### - What is the spread operator?

 spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots `(…)` to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.

### - List 4 things that the spread operator can do

1. Trying to pass an array to a JavaScript function expecting separate arguments.
    - i.g: `Math.max(...[1,3,5]) // 5`

2. Copying an array
    - i.g:

    ```JS
    const fruits = ['🍏','🍊','🍌','🍉','🍍']
    const moreFruits = [...fruits];
    console.log(moreFruits) // Array(5) [ "🍏", "🍊", "🍌", "🍉", "🍍" ]
    ```

3. Concatenating or combining arrays
    - i.g:

```JS
    const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
    const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
    const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
    console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩
```

4. Adding an item to a list

    - i.g:

```JS
    const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
    const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
    console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]
```

### - Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

i.g: 

```JS
    const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
    const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
    const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
    console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩
```

### - Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

i.g:

```JS
    const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
    const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
    console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]
```

### - Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

i.g:

```JS
    const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
    const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
    const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
    console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
    const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
    objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
```

## How to Pass Functions Between Components

### - In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

He pass it as a `Prop` from the parent to the child component

### - In your own words, what does the increment function do?

It used to increment the value of the counter based on change of an event.

### - How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

Pass it using as a Prop `this.theNameOfTheMethod` and in child `this.props.theNameOfTheMethod()`

### - How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?

`this.props.theNameOfTheMethod()`
