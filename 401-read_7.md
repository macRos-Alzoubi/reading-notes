# OO Design

## Don't repeat yourself

is a principle of software development aimed at **reducing repetition** of software patterns, replacing it with
abstractions or using **data normalization** to avoid redundancy.

The DRY principle is stated as "**Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation
within a system**".

The principle has been formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer. They apply it
quite broadly to include "database schemas, test plans, the build system, even documentation". When the DRY principle is
applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically
unrelated elements. Additionally, elements that are logically related all change predictably and uniformly, and are thus
kept in sync. Besides using methods and subroutines in their code, Thomas and Hunt rely on code generators, automatic
build systems, and scripting languages to observe the DRY principle across layers.

## Rule of three ("Three strikes and you refactor")

is a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when similar pieces of code should be refactored to avoid duplication. It
states that two instances of similar code do not require refactoring, but when similar code is used three times, it
should be extracted into a new procedure.

**Duplication** is considered a bad practice in programming because it makes the code harder to maintain. When the rule
encoded in a replicated piece of code changes, whoever maintains the code will have to change it in all places
correctly.

The rule implies that the cost of maintenance certainly outweighs the cost of refactoring and potential bad design when
there are three copies, and may or may not if there are only two copies.

## You aren't gonna need it

is a principle of extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary.

Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.

## Minimum viable product

is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for
future product development.

A focus on releasing an MVP means that developers potentially avoid lengthy and (ultimately) unnecessary work. Instead,
they iterate on working versions and respond to feedback, challenging and validating assumptions about a product's
requirements.

The MVP is analogous to experimentation in the scientific method applied in the context of validating business
hypotheses.

It is utilized so that prospective entrepreneurs would know whether a given business idea would actually be viable and
profitable by testing the assumptions behind a product or business idea

The concept can be used to validate a market need for a product and for incremental developments of an existing product.

As it tests a potential business model to customers to see how the market would react, it is especially useful for
new/startup companies who are more concerned with finding out where potential business opportunities exist rather than
executing a prefabricated, isolated business model.
