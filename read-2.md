#Intro to Version Control System and GIT

**VCS**:

**=>** is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version.

There are three types of VCS:

1. **Local Version Control(LVCS)**:  Many years ago, programmers created Local Version Control systems. A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.

2. **Centralized Version Control(CVCS)**:  This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. This method facilitates the collaboration between the teams of developers on a single file or set of files

3. **Distributed Version Control(DVCS)**:  addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. If a CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions.
To prevent this type of catastrophic loss, a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.

Once we explane what is VCS we can explane what is GIT

**GIT:**  Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

**Files States**: Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.

1. **Committed**: Data is safely stored in a local database.
2. **Modified**: File has been changed but not committed to the database.
3. **Staged**:  Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot

- **Download Git**

  Git can be installed in three ways:
   1. Install as a package
   2. Install via another installer
   3. Download and compile the source code.

  - **Mac OS X**:
    - **Terminal**: on a Mac (for Mavericks 10.9 and above) 
                    is running Git from the Terminal. If Git is not installed, you will see a prompt for installation.
    - **Git Website**: You can also download Git by visiting this                      link and following the posted directions =>                     http://git-scm.com/download/mac
    - **GitHub**: install Git as part of the GitHub for Mac install               => http://mac.github.com

  - **Windows**: 
    - **Git Website**: http://git-scm.com/download/win
    - **GitHub** : install Git as part of the GitHub
                   => http://windows.github.com
  
  - **Linux**
    - **Package Manager**:  
          You can try installing Git via your                   distribution’s inherent package management tool.
        - For ***Fedora***: ```$ sudo yum install git```
        -  For ***Ubuntu***: ```$ sudo apt-get install git```
