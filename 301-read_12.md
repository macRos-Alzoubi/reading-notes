# Mongo and Mongoose

## nosql vs sql

### Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

|   SQL   |   NoSQ   |
|:-------:|:--------:|
| Relational Databases | non-relational or distributed database |
| table based databases | document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
| predefined schema | dynamic schema |
| vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
| structured query language  | Unstructured Query Language |

### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

If the data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined.

### Give a real world example

for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records ***SQL*** based databases are the best fit.

### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

If the data is highly unstructured, and relationships among the data entities are not clearly defined in such scenarios, NoSQL is a better choice.

### Give a real world example.

Geo-spatial information, and satellite data are highly unstructured.

### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL

### Which type of database is best for scalability?

NoSQL

## sql vs nosql (Video)

### What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language.

### What is a realational database?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

### What type of structure does a relational database work with?

a collection of tables, each having a unique name.

### What is a ‘schema’?

A schema is a model for describing the structure of information.

### What is a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

### Howo does it work?

It have collections of document ther is no schema.

### What is inside of a Mongo database?

stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. 

### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

NonSQL because ther is no schema.

### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have.
