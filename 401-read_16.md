# Spring Authentication

## Spring Security overview

### Authentication and Access Control

Application security boils down to two more or less independent problems: authentication (who are you?) and
authorization (what are you allowed to do?). Sometimes people say “access control” instead of "authorization", which can
get confusing, but it can be helpful to think of it that way because “authorization” is overloaded in other places.
Spring Security has an architecture that is designed to separate authentication from authorization and has strategies
and extension points for both.

#### Authentication

The main strategy interface for authentication is AuthenticationManager, which has only one method:

```java
public interface AuthenticationManager {

    Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication)
            throws AuthenticationException;
}
```

An `AuthenticationManager` can do one of 3 things in its `authenticate()` method:

1. Return an Authentication (normally with authenticated=true) if it can verify that the input represents a valid
   principal.
2. Throw an AuthenticationException if it believes that the input represents an invalid principal.
3. Return null if it cannot decide.

##### Customizing Authentication Managers

Spring Security provides some configuration helpers to quickly get common authentication manager features set up in your
application. The most commonly used helper is the `AuthenticationManagerBuilder`, which is great for setting up
in-memory,
`JDBC`, or `LDAP` user details or for adding a custom UserDetailsService. The following example shows an application
that configures the global (parent) `AuthenticationManager`:

```java

@Configuration
public class ApplicationSecurity extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

   ... // web stuff here

    @Autowired
    public void initialize(AuthenticationManagerBuilder builder, DataSource dataSource) {
        builder.jdbcAuthentication().dataSource(dataSource).withUser("dave")
                .password("secret").roles("USER");
    }

}
```

This example relates to a web application, but the usage of AuthenticationManagerBuilder is more widely applicable (see
Web Security for more detail on how web application security is implemented). Note that the AuthenticationManagerBuilder
is @Autowired into a method in a @Bean — that is what makes it build the global (parent) AuthenticationManager. In
contrast, consider the following example:

```java

@Configuration
public class ApplicationSecurity extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    DataSource dataSource;

   ... // web stuff here

    @Override
    public void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder builder) {
        builder.jdbcAuthentication().dataSource(dataSource).withUser("dave")
                .password("secret").roles("USER");
    }

}
```

#### Authorization or Access Control

Once authentication is successful, we can move on to authorization, and the core strategy here is AccessDecisionManager.
There are three implementations provided by the framework and all three delegate to a chain of AccessDecisionVoter
instances, a bit like the ProviderManager delegates to AuthenticationProviders.

An AccessDecisionVoter considers an Authentication (representing a principal) and a secure Object, which has been
decorated with ConfigAttributes:

```java
boolean supports(ConfigAttribute attribute);

        boolean supports(Class<?> clazz);

        int vote(Authentication authentication,S object,
        Collection<ConfigAttribute> attributes);
```

The Object is completely generic in the signatures of the AccessDecisionManager and AccessDecisionVoter. It represents
anything that a user might want to access (a web resource or a method in a Java class are the two most common cases).
The ConfigAttributes are also fairly generic, representing a decoration of the secure Object with some metadata that
determines the level of permission required to access it. ConfigAttribute is an interface. It has only one method (which
is quite generic and returns a String), so these strings encode in some way the intention of the owner of the resource,
expressing rules about who is allowed to access it. A typical ConfigAttribute is the name of a user role (like
ROLE_ADMIN or ROLE_AUDIT), and they often have special formats (like the ROLE_ prefix) or represent expressions that
need to be evaluated.

Most people use the default AccessDecisionManager, which is AffirmativeBased (if any voters return affirmatively, access
is granted). Any customization tends to happen in the voters, either by adding new ones or modifying the way that the
existing ones work.

It is very common to use ConfigAttributes that are Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expressions — for example,
isFullyAuthenticated() && hasRole('user'). This is supported by an AccessDecisionVoter that can handle the expressions
and create a context for them. To extend the range of expressions that can be handled requires a custom implementation
of SecurityExpressionRoot and sometimes also SecurityExpressionHandler.

#### Web Security

Spring Security in the web tier (for UIs and HTTP back ends) is based on Servlet Filters, so it is helpful to first look
at the role of Filters generally. The following picture shows the typical layering of the handlers for a single HTTP
request.

### Spring Auth cheat sheet

1. set up a user model and repo
2. create a controller for that model
3. `UserDetailsServiceImpl` implements `UserDetailsService`
   gets a User from the database by username (make sure your repository has the method to make this easy!)
4. `ApplicationUser` implements `UserDetails`
   use IntelliJ to implement the methods; make the boolean ones all return true
5. WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter
    - has a UserDetailsService
    - passwordEncoder bean
    - configure AuthManagerBuilder
        - `auth.userDetailsService(userDetailsService).passwordEncoder(passwordEncoder());`
    - configure HttpSecurity
        - cors? csrf?
        - matchers for URLs that are allowed
            - ensure that login and signup URLs allowed; also consider homepage etc.
        - formLogin with login page set up
        - logout

```java
    @Override
@Bean
public AuthenticationManager authenticationManagerBean()throws Exception{
        return super.authenticationManagerBean();
        }
```

6. registration page
   - create it w/ form 
   - ensure it posts to a route your controller is ready for 
   - check it's saving in the DB

```java
  // maybe autologin?
    Authentication authentication=new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(newUser,null,new ArrayList<>());
        SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication);
```

7. login page
   - create it w/ form
   - ensure it posts to the route you specified in web config
   - try it out!
   - add to a template w/ things about the Principal
