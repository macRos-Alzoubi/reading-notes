none of the techniques we use today work well when you need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the entire world.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

## What does a GET do?

**GET**is used to request data from a specified resource.

## What does a POST do?

**POST** is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

## What does PUT do?

**PUT** is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

The difference between **POST** and **PUT** is that **PUT** requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same **PUT** request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a **POST** request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.

## What does PATCH do?

The HTTP PATCH request method applies partial modifications to a resource.
