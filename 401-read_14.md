# Trees

## Common Terminology

1. **Node** - A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes
2. **Root** - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
3. **K** - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k
   = 2
4. **Left** - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
5. **Right** - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
6. **Edge** - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
7. **Leaf** - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
8. **Height** - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

## Traversals

An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the
contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

- Depth First
- Breadth First

### Depth First

Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways
to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root. Here are three
methods for depth first traversal:

- Pre-order: `root >> left >> right`
- In-order: `left >> root >> right`
- Post-order: `left >> right >> root`

#### Pre-order

Let’s break down the pre-order traversal. Here is the pseudocode for this traversal method:

```
ALGORITHM preOrder(root)

  OUTPUT <-- root.value

  if root.left is not NULL
      preOrder(root.left)

  if root.right is not NULL
      preOrder(root.right)
```

Pre-order means that the root has to be looked at first. In our case, looking at the root just means that we output its
value. When we call preOrder for the first time, the root will be added to the call stack:

Next, we start reading our preOrder function’s code from top to bottom. The first line of code reads this:
`OUTPUT <-- root.value`

This means that we will output the root.value out to the console. Then, our next block of code instructs us to check if
our root has a left node set. If the root does, we will then send the left node to our preOrder method recursively. This
means that we make another function call, where B is our new root:

![](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/images/DepthTraversal2.PNG)

This process continues until we reach a leaf node. Here’s the state of our tree when we hit our first leaf, D:

It’s important to note a few things that are about to happen:

The program will look for both a root.left and a root.right. Both will return null, so it will end the execution of that
method call D will pop off of the call stack and the root will be reassigned back to B This is the heart of recursion:
when we complete a function call, we pop it off the stack and are able to continue execution through the previous
function call

![](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/images/DepthTraversal4.PNG)

The code block will now pick up where it left off when B was the root. Since it already looked for root.left, it will
now look for root.right.

![](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/images/DepthTraversal5.PNG)

E will output to the console. Since E is a leaf, it will complete the method code block, and pop E off of the call stack
and make its way back up to B.

![](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/images/DepthTraversal6.PNG)

In the function call, B has already checked for root.left, and root.right. There are no further lines of code to
execute, so B will be popped off the call stack, so that we can resume execution of A.

![](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/images/DepthTraversal7.PNG)

Following the same pattern as we did with the other nodes, A’s call stack frame will pick up where it left off, and
check out root.right. C will be added to the call stack frame, and it will the new function’s root.

![](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/images/DepthTraversal8.PNG)

C will be outputted to the console, and root.left will be evaluated. Because C has a left child, preOrder will be
called, with the parameter root.left.

![](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/images/DepthTraversal9.PNG)

At this point, the program will find that F does not have any children and it will make its way back up the call stack
up to C.

![](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/images/DepthTraversal10.PNG)

C does not have a root.right, so it will pop off the call stack and return to A.

### Breadth First

Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.

```
ALGORITHM breadthFirst(root)
// INPUT  <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- front node of queue to console

  Queue breadth <-- new Queue()
  breadth.enqueue(root)

  while breadth.peek()
    node front = breadth.dequeue()
    OUTPUT <-- front.value

    if front.left is not NULL
      breadth.enqueue(front.left)

    if front.right is not NULL
      breadth.enqueue(front.right)
```

### Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees

In all of our examples, we’ve been using a Binary Tree. Trees can have any number of children per node, but Binary Trees
restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children).

There is no specific sorting order for a binary tree. Nodes can be added into a binary tree wherever space allows. Here
is what a binary tree looks like:

#### K-ary Trees

If Nodes are able have more than 2 child nodes, we call the tree that contains them a K-ary Tree. In this type of tree
we use K to refer to the maximum number of children that each Node is able to have.
