## Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on
2 factors:

1. Running Time (also known as time efficiency / complexity)
   The amount of time a function needs to complete.

2. Memory Space (also known as space efficiency / complexity)
   The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.

- **Overview**

  Big O’s role in algorithm efficiency is to describe the Worst Case of efficiency an algorithm can have in performing
  it’s job. It specifically looks at the factors mentioned above, which we often refer to as Space and Time. In order to
  analyze these limiting factors, we should consider 4 Key Areas for analysis:

    1. Input Size
    2. Units of Measurement
    3. Orders of Growth
    4. Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case

- **Input Size**

  Input Size refers to the size of the parameter values that are read by the algorithm. This does not simply refer to
  the number of parameters an algorithm reads, but takes into account the size of each parameter value as well.

  **Example**: If a function uses an array or list as one parameter, then the number of elements within that array or
  list will directly increase the Input Size of that parameter.

  We will use the letter **n** to refer to the Input Size value.

  The higher this number, the more likely there will be an increase to **Running** Time and **Memory** Space.

- **Units of Measurement**

  To evaluate a function for Time and Space complexity, we need a way to measure each of these factors.

  In order to quantify the Running Time in our analysis, we will consider Three Measurements of time:

    1. The time in milliseconds from the start of a function execution until it ends.
    2. The number of operations that are executed
    3. The number of “Basic Operations” that are executed

  In order to quantify Memory Space, we can consider Four Sources of Memory Usage during function run-time:

    1. The amount of space needed to hold the code for the algorithm.
    2. The amount of space needed to hold the input data
    3. The amount of space needed for the output data.
    4. The amount of space needed to hold working space during the calculation

- **Orders of Growth**

  We can describe overall efficiency by using the input size **n** and measuring the overall Units of Space and Time
  required for the given input size **n**. As the value of **n** grows, the Order of Growth represents the increase in
  Running Time or Memory Space.

- **Constant Complexity**

  means that no matter what inputs are thrown at our algorithm, it always uses the same amount of time or space. The
  number 1 is used to represent a constant value.

- **Logarithmic Complexity**

  represents a function that sees a decrease in the rate of complexity growth, the greater our value of n. This can be
  seen when we are performing calculations on sorted data.

- **Linear Complexity**

  the size of our inputs ‘n’ will directly determine the amount of Memory Space used and Running Time length. This is a
  very common efficiency and is usually used to denote functions with loops, or often algorithms that use recursion.

## Linked Lists
- 

- **What is a Linked List**

  A **Linked List** is a sequence of **Nodes** that are **connected/linked** to each other. The most defining feature of
  a Linked List is that each **Node** references the next **Node** in the **link**.

  There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly. We will be implementing a Singly Linked List in this
  implementation.

- **Terminology**

    1. Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
    2. **Singly** - **Singly** refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there
       is **only one reference**, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
    3. **Doubly** - **Doubly** refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means
       that
       **there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node**.
    4. **Node** - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each
       link.
    5. **Next** - Each node contains a property called Next. **This** property contains the reference to the next node.
    6. **Head** - The Head is a reference of type **Node** to the first node in a linked list.
    7. **Current** - The Current is a reference of type **Node** to the node that is currently being looked at. When
       traversing, you create a new Current variable at the **Head** to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of
       the linked list.

- **What does it look like**

  This is what a Singly Linked List looks like

- **Traversal**

  When traversing a linked list, you are not able to use a foreach or for loop. We depend on the Next value in each node
  to guide us where the next reference is pointing.

  We can use `while loop => loop while current.next != null` or use recursion function call with the same condition as
  the base case.

- **Adding a Node**

    1. If the linked list is empty it is the ideal case or best case its Big O(1) just create new node with the new
       pointer points to null
    2. If the Linked list is not empty.
        1. if you want to add at the beginning of the list its big O(n), just create new node with the next pointer
           point to the head pointer.
        2. if you want to add at the end, and you don't implement a tail pointer traverse until you reach the last node
           make the current next pointer points to the new node.
        3. if you implement tail pointer simply let its next pointer point to the new node and the Big O(1).
        4. if you want to add in the middle, or you provide an index traverse until the index or the middle then make
           the new `node.next = current.next` and then make `current.next = new node`.
