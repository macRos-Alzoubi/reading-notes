# Java Basics

## -Variables

The Java programming language defines the following kinds of variables:

- **Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields)** Technically speaking, objects store their individual states in "non-static
  fields", that is, fields declared without the static keyword. Non-static fields are also known as instance variables
  because their values are unique to each instance of a class (to each object, in other words); the currentSpeed of one
  bicycle is independent of the currentSpeed of another.
- **Class Variables (Static Fields)** A class variable is any field declared with the static modifier; this tells the
  compiler that there is exactly one copy of this variable in existence, regardless of how many times the class has been
  instantiated. A field defining the number of gears for a particular kind of bicycle could be marked as static since
  conceptually the same number of gears will apply to all instances. The code static int numGears = 6; would create such
  a static field. Additionally, the keyword final could be added to indicate that the number of gears will never change.
- **Local Variables** Similar to how an object stores its state in fields, a method will often store its temporary state
  in local variables. The syntax for declaring a local variable is similar to declaring a field (for example, int count
  = 0;). There is no special keyword designating a variable as local; that determination comes entirely from the
  location in which the variable is declared â€” which is between the opening and closing braces of a method. As such,
  local variables are only visible to the methods in which they are declared; they are not accessible from the rest of
  the class.
- **Parameters** You've already seen examples of parameters, both in the Bicycle class and in the main method of the "
  Hello World!" application. Recall that the signature for the main method is public static void main(String[] args).
  Here, the args variable is the parameter to this method. The important thing to remember is that parameters are always
  classified as "variables" not "fields". This applies to other parameter-accepting constructs as well (such as
  constructors and exception handlers) that you'll learn about later in the tutorial.

## - Operators

As we explore the operators of the Java programming language, it may be helpful for you to know ahead of time which
operators have the highest precedence. The operators in the following table are listed according to precedence order.
The closer to the top of the table an operator appears, the higher its precedence. Operators with higher precedence are
evaluated before operators with relatively lower precedence. Operators on the same line have equal precedence. When
operators of equal precedence appear in the same expression, a rule must govern which is evaluated first. All binary
operators except for the assignment operators are evaluated from left to right; assignment operators are evaluated right
to left.

Operator Precedence

| Operators    | Precedence |
| :------: | :---------------------: |
|postfix |    expr++ expr--|
|unary|    ++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !|
|multiplicative|	|* / %|
|additive|    + -|
|shift    |<< >> >>>|
|relational|    < > <= >= instanceof|
|equality|    == !=|
|bitwise AND|    &|
|bitwise exclusive OR|    ^|
|bitwise inclusive OR| &#124; |
|logical AND|    && |
|logical OR    | &#124; &#124; |
|ternary|    ? :
|assignment|    = += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=|

## - Expressions, Statements, and Blocks

### +Expressions

An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to
the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value.

- i.g:

```Java  
int cadence = 0;
  anArray[0] = 100;
  System.out.println("Element 1 at index 0: " + anArray[0]);
```

### + Statements

Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a complete unit of execution. The
following types of expressions can be made into a statement by terminating the expression with a semicolon `(;)`.

- i.g: `aValue = 8933.234;`

### + Blocks

A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is
allowed. The following example, BlockDemo, illustrates the use of blocks:

```java
class BlockDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean condition = true;
        if (condition) { // begin block 1
            System.out.println("Condition is true.");
        } // end block one
        else { // begin block 2
            System.out.println("Condition is false.");
        } // end block 2
    }
}
```

## - Control Flow Statements

The statements inside your source files are generally executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear.
Control flow statements, however, break up the flow of execution by employing decision-making, looping, and branching,
enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code. This section describes the decision-making
statements (`if-then, if-then-else, switch`), the looping statements (`for, while, do-while`), and the branching
statements (`break, continue, return`) supported by the Java programming language.
