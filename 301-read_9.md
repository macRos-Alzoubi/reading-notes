# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

## Functional Programming Concepts

### What is functional programming?

In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.

### What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

In computer programming, a pure function is a function that has the following properties:

1. The function return values are identical for identical arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams).

2. The function application has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input/output streams).

Thus a pure function is a computational analogue of a mathematical function. Some authors, particularly from the imperative language community, use the term "pure" for all functions that just have the above property **2**.

### What are the benefits of a pure function?

1. Pure functions are better than impure functions
2. Pure functions are easier to test
3. Functional programming leads to fewer bugs
4. Functional code tends to have its state isolated, making it 5 easier to comprehend
5. Function signatures are more trusted
6. Concurrency is more easily kept safe
7. Recursion is simpler, though not necessarily easier to learn
8. Immutable variables lead to fewer side-effects

### What is immutability?

 (in object-oriented programming) the characteristic of an object with a fixed structure and properties whose values cannot be changed:
Informing the compiler about the immutability of the variable allows for optimizing the code and logic behind the implementation of the code.

### What is Referential transparency?

The term "referential transparency" comes from analytical philosophy, the branch of philosophy that analyzes natural language constructs, statements and arguments based on the methods of logic and mathematics. In other words, it is the closest subject outside computer science to what we call programming language semantics. The philosopher Willard Quine was responsible for initiating the concept of referential transparency, but it was also implicit in the approaches of Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead.

At its core, "referential transparency" is a very simple and clear idea. The term "referent" is used in analytical philosophy to talk about the thing that an expression refers to. It is roughly the same as what we mean by "meaning" or "denotation" in programming language semantics. Using Andrew Birkett's example (blog post), the term "the capital of Scotland" refers to the city of Edinburgh. That is a straightforward example of a "referent".

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

### What is a module?

It's another javascript file.

### What does the word ‘require’ do?

`require()` is not part of the standard JavaScript API. But in `Node.js`, it's a built-in function with a special purpose: to load modules.

### How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

Using the require() function specifing the path of the file that we want.

i.g: `const lib = require("./lib/add");`.

### What do we have to do to make a module available?

Export the module first and then import it using `requre()`;
